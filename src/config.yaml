∫P1(x)/P2(x)dx + ∫Q1(y)/Q2(y)dy = C
Afterward, we find special solutions Q2(y)·P2(x) = 0 and verify whether they are included in the overall solution. If not, we delineate them as a separate solution.

Note: The solution obtained for y by computing these integrals may be implicitly defined. Rearranging the solution may be necessary to obtain an explicit expression for y, although in some cases, expressing y explicitly may not be possible.```

User`s differential equation: dy/dx = (1+y^2)/(1+x^2)

Unchecked solution: 
<Correct solution:
Step 1: Consider the equation dy/dx = (1+y^2)/(1+x^2)
Step 2: Multiply by dx/(1+y^2) and then integrate ∫(dy/(1+y^2)) = ∫(dx/(1+x^2))
Step 3: Integrate using the substitution y = tan(u) and x = tan(v) to simplify the integrals
Step 4: Write the final result as y = tan(arctan(x) + C)>
